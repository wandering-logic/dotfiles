# dotfiles

* Git clone this to your homedir.
* It will be named "dotfiles".
* `mv dotfiles .dotfile-repo`
* symlink the `bin` and `emacs.d` dirs into homedir
* symlink the .files into homedir


Todo:

* Deal with gnome terminal config, and maybe cinnnamon config
* write a script to automate initial checkout
