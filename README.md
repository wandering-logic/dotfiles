# dotfiles

Mainly bash and emacs configs.  They are "notable" only in that I prefer to run
emacs in a 16-color xterm, which probably won't appeal to a wide audience.

* Git clone this to your homedir.
* It will be named "dotfiles".
* `mv dotfiles .dotfile-repo`
* run ./dotfile-repo/create-links to:
** symlink the `bin` and `emacs.d` dirs into homedir
** symlink the .files into homedir


Todo:

* Deal with gnome terminal config, and maybe cinnnamon config
